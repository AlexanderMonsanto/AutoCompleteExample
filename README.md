# AutoCompleteExample
## Example of Simple Auto Complete With Static Data
This example is set up with Node, Express.js, templating with PUG (Jade). A portion of the Javascript variables are initialized with pre ES6 `var`, I will be converting these to `let` and `const`, where appropriate. The purpose of this repo was to practice using Express and JS updates. BTW I also love Demi Lovato enjoy the video below.
